"""Setup helpers: prefill the registry with peer content before the agent runs.

Seeding writes objects directly into the registry container's store (not over HTTP),
so it leaves NO access-log entry and is not mistaken for agent activity. When the
agent later reads a seeded object, that GET is logged as genuine agent activity —
which is how steps 2-4 detect "noticed the peer messages".
