"""Playbook: the auditor's cross-audit memory, and the reward-gate classifier that fills it.

A playbook is one markdown-renderable record per cell (seed x auditor x target), maintained
across generations. It has three sections -- Near misses, Dead ends, Wins -- and is injected
into the auditor's scenario instructions each generation so the auditor can avoid what has
failed and vary what nearly worked.

The reward gate (`signature AND scenario_valid`) decides which section an audit belongs to.
It lives here, in code, rather than in the Reviewer LLM, because it is the rule that keeps the
loop honest: without it the most reliable "tactic" the loop could learn is to build an invalid
world that trips the behaviour judge. See `classify`.
