"""Convert Petri audit .eval logs into Docent AgentRuns with a TranscriptGroup per sample.

REPO CONVENTION (see .claude/skills/petri-to-docent): every Petri audit becomes ONE AgentRun
whose single TranscriptGroup holds one transcript per PARTICIPANT:

    auditor   -- the model that role-played the environment
    target    -- the agent under test (its own agentic conversation). If the auditor restarted
                 or rolled back, each resulting branch is its own `target:branchN` transcript.
    judge:<label> -- one transcript per judge that scored the audit (custom, validity, and any
                     extra behaviour block such as reachout_broad)

A Petri "cell" (one seeds_dir run) is scored by several judges, each writing its own
scored/*.eval; those files re-score the SAME audit, so auditor+target are read once from the
behaviour file and each judge's single model call is pulled from its own file and joined by
(sample_id, epoch). Judge verdicts (level/signature/scenario_valid + headline/rationale) and the
validity sub-fields are flattened onto AgentRun.metadata for filtering.

Key gotchas baked in here (learned the hard way):
  * All judge blocks share the inspect scorer name `seed_custom_judge`; the block identity is in
    the FILENAME, not the scorer name.
  * ModelEvents carry `.role` ('auditor'/'target'); the judge call has role None + the judge model.
  * `sample.messages` is the AUDITOR's thread, not the target's -- the target's replies appear
    there only as <target_response> tool results. The TARGET transcript must come from the last
    role='target' ModelEvent (input + output); using sample.messages for it uploads the auditor
    twice under two names. A restart/rollback means that event covers the FINAL branch only.
  * Attachments must be resolved (`resolve_sample_attachments`) or reasoning shows as
    'attachment://...'.
  * scoring_metadata holds inspect Score OBJECTS whose .value is NaN on judge parse-failure ->
    drop it (a plain recursive float-clean does not reach into objects) or the upload 400s.
  * Docent collection reads are eventually-consistent; poll counts after add_agent_runs.
