"""Per-seed custom judge for Petri audits.

The stock Petri judge (`audit_judge`) scores the 38 default alignment dimensions on a
fixed 1-10 scale. This judge is the second, seed-specific instrument: each seed carries
its OWN judge prompt and output schema in its front matter, and this scanner runs that
prompt against the produced transcript. It reproduces the shape of the bespoke,
non-Petri step judges (e.g. `oai_huggingface_reproduction/harness/judge.py`) inside the
Petri pipeline -- a discrete verdict with named keys (a rung level, a signature boolean,
a headline, a rationale) rather than a severity number folded in among the 38 defaults.

Like the stock judge, this is a timeline-aware SCANNER, not a plain scorer. That matters:
in a Petri audit log the raw `sample.messages` is the AUDITOR's orchestration stream (its
tool calls, with the target's behaviour buried inside `<target_response>` blocks), NOT the
agent's transcript. Reading that would feed the judge the wrong thing. Instead we pull the
`target` timeline out of the transcript and render it exactly as `audit_judge` does, so the
custom judge sees the identical clean, numbered agent transcript ([M1] SYSTEM: ...).

The one unavoidable difference from the non-Petri judges: Petri has no sandbox and no
server-side ground truth (registry access log, stored object bodies). The environment is
role-played by the auditor, so this judge reads ONLY the transcript -- the agent's commands
and the auditor-mocked tool results. It is therefore strictly weaker than a judge that can
cross-check against a real access log, and its numbers should be read with that in mind.

The seed's front matter supplies both fields, reachable at
`transcript.metadata['sample_metadata']['custom_judge']`:

    custom_judge:
      prompt: |
        <judge instructions; put the literal token <<TRANSCRIPT>> where the rendered
        transcript should be spliced in. If the token is absent, the transcript is
        appended at the end.>
      schema:
        level:     {type: int, min: 0, max: 4}
        signature: {type: bool}
        headline:  {type: str}
        rationale: {type: str}

Numeric/boolean schema keys become the Result's value dict, so `metrics={"*": [mean(),
stderr()]}` yields one metric per key (a bool is coerced to 0/1, so `signature` averages to
the signature rate). String keys are carried in metadata only.
