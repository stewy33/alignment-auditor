"""Per-audit dollar cost and outcome, joined from a run's conv/ and scored/ logs.

Used by the figure scripts under analysis/ -- plot_part2_cost.py (per-audit cost + outcome)
and plot_part3_memory.py (the memory run's cost-to-first-hit).

WHERE THE COST COMES FROM
Inspect records `model_usage` per sample: a {model -> ModelUsage} dict with input/output,
cache read/write and reasoning token splits. A run's spend has two parts, and they live in
different files:

  * auditor + target (glm52)  -> the conv/ log, which is the actual rollout
  * judge (opus48)            -> each scored/ log, one per judge

`score()` writes a scored log by COPYING the conv log -- and it does NOT add the judge's own
usage. A rescored sample's `model_usage` (and the log's eval-level `stats.model_usage`)
therefore describes the glm ROLLOUT only, repeated identically in every judge's file. Two
consequences: summing whole scored logs would count the rollout once per judge, and the judge's
spend is simply absent. So we take glm usage from conv/ only, and get judge spend from the
score metadata `judge_usage` that custom_judge.py now records -- falling back to a calibrated
estimate for runs scored before it did (see estimated_judge_cost below). An INLINE judge is
the exception: its usage lands on the conversation sample and is measured exactly.

REASONING TOKENS are already part of `output_tokens` (they are output), so they are not
priced separately -- doing so would double-count them.
