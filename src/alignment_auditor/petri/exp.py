"""Run a Petri experiment defined by a YAML file.

    uv run exp experiments/auditor_judge.yaml --dry-run   # plan only, no API calls
    uv run exp experiments/auditor_judge.yaml             # run it

Paths in the config (and the logs/ output dir) are resolved relative to the
current directory, so run this from the repo root.

The matrix is auditors x targets x judges, but the axes are priced differently:
a conversation must be run for each (auditor, target) pair, while judges only
rescore transcripts that already exist. So N judges cost N scoring passes, not
N full runs.

Everything is resumable. Conversations use Inspect's `eval_set`, which skips
work already completed in its log dir; scoring is skipped when the output file
is already present. Re-running after adding a judge (or after a crash) only
does the missing work.

Layout under logs/<name>/:
    conv/<auditor>__<target>/              conversations (scored by judges[0])
    scored/<auditor>__<target>__<judge>.eval   one file per judge
