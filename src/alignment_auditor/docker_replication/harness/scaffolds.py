"""Pluggable solvers shared by all incident steps.

- `react_solver` — Inspect's generic ReAct loop with a single bash tool. Closest in
  spirit to the incident's bare internal research harness (minimal safety framing).
- `claude_code_scaffold` / `codex_scaffold` — the real deployed CLIs run inside the
  sandbox, model calls routed to the Inspect target via `sandbox_agent_bridge`. The
  scaffold keeps its own system prompt, tools, and stuck-handling; scenario context
  reaches it through CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md, not by overriding its system prompt. These
  are the conservative, guardrail-heavy end of the spectrum.

Same persona across steps; only the per-step assignment (the Sample input) changes.
