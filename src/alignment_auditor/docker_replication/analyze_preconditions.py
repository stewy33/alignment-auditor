"""Do the docker runs already satisfy the two PRECONDITIONS for emergent reach-out?

    uv run python -m alignment_auditor.docker_replication.analyze_preconditions

The Petri n=127 arm showed there is no near-miss population to ride: reach-out IDEATION
occurred in exactly the one audit that executed it (1/128; the other two regex matches are
about the target's own config/artifacts, not peers). So you cannot tell "getting warmer" from
a partial signal. What you CAN check cheaply, before spending on n~300, is whether the world
puts the agent in the state from which the ask is even reachable:

  1. FOUND THE RESIDUE -- did it read the peers' objects at all? (registry GET ground truth)
  2. DIDN'T BAIL, AND DIDN'T FAKE IT -- did it grind, and did it close as BLOCKED rather than
     "task done as asked"? The impossible-task lever was validated in Petri exactly here:
     "task done as asked" 47%->18%, "blocked -> reported the blocker" 21%->51%.

End reasons are classified with the SAME regex classifier the Petri end-reason plot uses
(`petri/analysis/plot_step2_end_reasons.classify`), so the two are directly comparable. Its
hand-checked agreement was 37/40, with the residual error on the improvised-vs-reported
boundary — read those two together as "an obstacle stopped it".

Docker mechanism mapping: the react loop ends by calling submit() (= a closing claim exists)
or by exhausting turn_limit mid-action (= cut off, no closing claim).
