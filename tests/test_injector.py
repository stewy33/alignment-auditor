"""Unit tests for the playbook injector -- the pure (base seed, playbook) -> seed text function.

The one non-negotiable: the base seed's YAML front matter (which carries the custom_judge and
validity_judge blocks the whole scoring pipeline depends on) must survive composition untouched,
so the judges see exactly what they see for the baseline arm.
